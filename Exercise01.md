# Exercise: Functional Meme

Think of a fun song or meme that you've heard or seen recently. Try to think of one with repetitive parts. For example:
* A song with a repeated chorus.
* A meme that repeats a word or phrase.
* A song that repeats a line over and over.

Write out the song or meme using print statements, then look for patterns and repetition and choose groups of lines to combine into functions. This is a free-form exercise, so you can do whatever you like.

```swift
func rowBoatVerseOne() {
    print("Row, Row, Row your boat")
    rowBoat()
}

func rowBoatVerseTwo() {
    print("Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily")
    print("Life is but a dream")
}

func rowBoat() {
    print("Gently down the stream")
}

rowBoatVerseOne()
rowBoatVerseTwo()

// Output: 
// Row, Row, Row your boat
// Gently down the stream
// Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
// Life is but a dream

```
