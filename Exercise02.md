# Exercise: Personal Meme

Copy the functions you made in the previous exercise to this page if you like or write them out again for practice. Or even make a whole new set.

Inside one of the functions, make changes that make the whole text mean something different, or make it funnier. You could change a name to your name or a friendâ€™s, change a word to something else that rhymes, or just play around.

```swift
func rowBoatVerseOne() {
    print("Drive, Drive, Drive your car")
    rowBoat()
}

func rowBoatVerseTwo() {
    print("Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily")
    print("We about to Crash")
}

func rowBoat() {
    print("Gently down state highway 33")
}

rowBoatVerseOne()
rowBoatVerseTwo()

// Output:
// Drive, Drive, Drive your car
// Gently down state highway 33
// Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
// We about to Crash

```
