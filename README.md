# Lesson 06 - Functions

# Exercise: Functional Meme

Think of a fun song or meme that you've heard or seen recently. Try to think of one with repetitive parts. For example:
* A song with a repeated chorus.
* A meme that repeats a word or phrase.
* A song that repeats a line over and over.

Write out the song or meme using print statements, then look for patterns and repetition and choose groups of lines to combine into functions. This is a free-form exercise, so you can do whatever you like.

```swift
func rowBoatVerseOne() {
    print("Row, Row, Row your boat")
    rowBoat()
}

func rowBoatVerseTwo() {
    print("Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily")
    print("Life is but a dream")
}

func rowBoat() {
    print("Gently down the stream")
}

rowBoatVerseOne()
rowBoatVerseTwo()

// Output: 
// Row, Row, Row your boat
// Gently down the stream
// Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
// Life is but a dream

```

# Exercise: Personal Meme

Copy the functions you made in the previous exercise to this page if you like or write them out again for practice. Or even make a whole new set.

Inside one of the functions, make changes that make the whole text mean something different, or make it funnier. You could change a name to your name or a friendâ€™s, change a word to something else that rhymes, or just play around.

```swift
func rowBoatVerseOne() {
    print("Drive, Drive, Drive your car")
    rowBoat()
}

func rowBoatVerseTwo() {
    print("Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily")
    print("We about to Crash")
}

func rowBoat() {
    print("Gently down state highway 33")
}

rowBoatVerseOne()
rowBoatVerseTwo()

// Output:
// Drive, Drive, Drive your car
// Gently down state highway 33
// Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
// We about to Crash

```
